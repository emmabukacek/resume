Hi! I'm pretty damned passionate about people management and feel strongly that
being an engineering manager is a full-time gig. In other words, I believe
hybrid roles where you are expected to manage folks and write software leads to
inadequate work in both disciplines. At best, you're able to help nudge projects
along and check the management boxes, and at worst, you're actively getting in
the way of your team and robbing them from opportunities.

Things I care most about as a manager are building solid teams and supporting
people by:
* Creating cultures of feedback and psychological safety
* Listening, coaching, mentoring, and supporting individual growth
  by seeking and delegating opportunities
* Building delivery systems that set folks up to succeed,
  e.g. Kanban boards with data-informed work-in-progress limits
* Creating great relationships and setting reasonable expectations with
  stakeholders
* Giving folks tools and clarity to navigate organizational expectations and
  process, e.g. performance reviews, promotions, etc.

But if it matters to you, as a programmer, I'm most experienced with **Javascript** and
**Node**, primarily with the frameworks **React** and **Hapi**. I've also
spent a fair amount of time with **Clojure**, **Ruby**, and **PHP** in the past.

I'm a big fan of **BDD** and **TDD**, using tools like **Cucumber** and anything
that gives me describe blocks.

I've worked or dabbled in **Python**, **Java**, **PHP**, and **Erlang** as well.

I'm a nerd suspectible to environment bike shedding, meaning I enjoy **Linux**
and tools like **Vim**, **Tmux**, and **Zsh**.

Sometimes I put on my DevOps hat with some experience in **Docker**,
**Mesos**, and **CI/CD**.

I also use DuckDuckGo a lot.
